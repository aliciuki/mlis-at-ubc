## LIBR 554 - Database Design

This is the (commented) MS SQL code we submitted for our Database Design course in Winter 2019.

Two of my teammates did most of the designing (business rules, ERM), while I built the database schema. A third teammate created and inserted the dummy data. Third teammate and I created the test queries together.
